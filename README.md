# Logistics Delivery Route Optimization using SQL

## 🚀 Objective
Optimize delivery routes to minimize total travel cost and improve delivery efficiency using SQL.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- Techniques: CTEs, Window functions, Indexing

## 🔍 What I built
- `sql/route_optimization.sql` — main script implementing grouping, ranking and route selection.
- `screenshots/` — query outputs and result snapshots.
- `ppt/project_presentation.pptx` — presentation outlining approach and results.

## ✅ Key SQL Concepts Used
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)
- Index creation for performance

## 📊 Results
- Outcome: (replace this line with your result, e.g., "Reduced average route overlap by 22% and improved query runtime by 30%")
- See screenshots in `screenshots/` for outputs.

## 📁 Files
- `sql/route_optimization.sql`
- `screenshots/`
- `ppt/project_presentation.pptx`

## ✍️ How to run
1. Import dataset into your MySQL/Postgres database.
2. Open `sql/route_optimization.sql` and run step by step.
3. Check results as shown in `screenshots/`.
